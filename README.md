## 🚀 Project Summary

This is a complete **end-to-end Business Intelligence project** simulating a real-world scenario where an organization's **email marketing team** needs a centralized system to analyze and optimize campaign performance. The project connects structured campaign data exported from **HubSpot**, loads it into a **MySQL database**, and builds an interactive and insightful dashboard using **Power BI**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In many organizations, **email campaign data is siloed**—spread across tools like HubSpot, Excel files, and internal CRMs. Marketing managers often waste time collecting data manually, switching between tabs, and struggling to track performance consistently.

**The key challenges:**
- Data is exported manually and lacks structure.
- No centralized dashboard for quick, high-level campaign insights.
- Inability to segment performance based on demographics, region, or device.
- No visibility into trends, A/B test results, or campaign effectiveness over time.

This project solves that by creating a **real-time, user-friendly dashboard** that answers critical questions like:
- Which campaign performed the best?
- What’s the open and click-through rate over the last 3 months?
- Which regions or customer segments respond better to emails?
- Are A/B tests leading to real improvements?

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Simulate a structured business database using **MySQL**.
- ✅ Connect and transform the data using **SQL + Power Query**.
- ✅ Visualize campaign performance using **Power BI interactive dashboards**.
